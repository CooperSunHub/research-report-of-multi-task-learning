# research-report-of-multi-task-learning
These are the research reports written by myself when I was a research assistant in 3th year at college.
The topic is multi-task learning.
You can read Readme.doc first. It is a content of these reports.

IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH ONE YOU SHOULD READ FIRST, PLEASE READ THE PDF DOCUMENT: research report presentation.pdf.

ENJOY YOURSELF AND HOPE I CAN HELP YOU!
